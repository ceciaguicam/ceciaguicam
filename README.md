### About me

Hi there! üëã I'm Ceci. I'm from Spain and I'm studying at University to be a primary teacherüè´. I live in Toledoüè∞, an old, beatiful and small city close to Madrid. I have two dogsüêï: Zero (a greyhound) and Roma (a maremma sheepdog). Both of them are really special (I imagine everybody says that about their dogs, though).

I started teaching educative robotics :robot: and programming :computer: to children and I became interested in the developer world. I've just finished a Web Design Bootcamp based in Javasript and Vue, and I'm starting a new one, this time related with fullstack developing. This GitHub profile is an exercise of this new bootcamp indeed.

I'm looking forward to learn more about programming because I love it! :heart:

### Bootcamp Exercise 1

For this first exercise I have to create a tablet with 5 commands and 2 alias commands I find usefull.

| Command | Description |
|--------:|-----------|
|     ls| Show all the files in the current folder|
|    cd| We move between folders   |
|     mkdir + folder_name| Creates a new folder with the name that we give to the command      |
|rm| It deletes a file|
|mv| We can use it to move a file from a folder to another, or to rename a file|

| Alias commands | Description |
|--------:|-----------|
|     alias findd="ls ~/ | grep $1" | Find a file by the name|
|    alias cl="clear"| It clears the terminal   |
